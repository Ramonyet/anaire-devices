Download IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from Arduino if you don't already have it
Choose the operating system, as an example we use windows 64bits
You can give some trusted message when you download, accept them
Complete the installation by accepting the completements you propose
On the anaire.org you'll find the .h and .config files you'll need for the microcontroller
In the IDE, choose > Preferences > Additional URL Manager Cards
Copy this URL http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
We choose the card we use
In the IDE, > Tools > Travert Manager > "esp8266 ESP266 comunity"
We seal the port, Tools > port (in our case we check in the device manager where it is, com3)
To assemble the components in the protoboard we follow the schematic of the anaire.org
The power adapter matches the pins of the protoboard, it is important for the power to match + and -
We recommend connecting the power wires first with red + and black wires -
With different color cables you can connect the data that communicates the microprocessor to the different sensors and components
Check the first time we give correinet that the green indicator light of the adapter turns on (otherwise disconnect and check)
Compile and record the program
It is advisable to open the serial monitor, > Serial Monitor Tools
(Follow the instructions marked in the program, wifi network settings if applicable)
We will already have a connection and we will be able to start with the serial monitor once it is reset that we read temperature, humidity and CO2 level
Enjoy the installation
